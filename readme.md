# Blog Calendar Templator

To plan my blog posts, I have a note with each month and week listed so I can put in ideas and titles for each given week. As I publish posts each Wednesday, the months where individual weeks end up in differ every year so I wrote this tiny utility to print me a new listing once a year.

## Usage

```
python generate.py [year]
```

Output (for 2024):

```
**January**
1:
2:
3:
4:
5:

**February**
6:
7:
8:
9:

**March**
10:
11:
12:
13:

# similarly rest of the year
```
